        <h3>About</h3>
        
        <p>Hi, I'm Korey McMurtrey.  I just completed the front-end web development course and am currently studying PHP at <a href="http://www.codelouisville.org/">Code Louisville</a>.</p>
        <p>My goal is to become a full-time web developer. Though coding and learning take up most of my free time these days, it rarely feels like work. I love solving coding problems and am always looking for something new to learn or work on.</p>
        <p>When I'm not developing and studying, I enjoy game nights with friends, catching up on my favorite shows, and a good cup of coffee.</p>
